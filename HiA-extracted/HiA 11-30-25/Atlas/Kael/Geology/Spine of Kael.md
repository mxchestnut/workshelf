# The Spine of Kael

The Spine of Kael is the primary structural feature supporting the floating continent. It consists of a vertically oriented mineral-megalith chain that channels skyflow forces upward, distributing lift across the entire landmass. The Spine anchors Kael’s crust plate, preventing rotational drift and stabilizing pressure layers above and below the floating shelf.

Structural analyses suggest:
- A core composed of ultra-dense lithic material capable of channeling atmospheric energy.
- Multiple resonance cavities that distribute skyflow upward.
- Stress fractures along the midline that correlate with historical dropoff events.
- A bottom-facing “pressure cone” that allows upward buoyancy from rising skyflow.

The Spine is the most stable and ancient geological feature on Kael, predating all known continental fragmentation.
