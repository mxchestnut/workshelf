# Aetherpulse (Aetheri Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Aetherpulse Aetheri serve as atmospheric energy conduits, with bodies incorporating high-density resonance nodes that store, channel, and release pure skyflow energy. They represent the most energetically focused Aetheri subtype.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their bodies emit soft pulsing glows in time with atmospheric fluctuation. Movement is smooth but punctuated by controlled bursts of energy.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Aetherpulse resonance amplifies raw skyflow into directional bursts or stabilization fields. They excel at correcting drift anomalies and energizing weakened atmospheric structures.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in high-altitude convergence points, skyflow wells, and atmospheric resonance nodes. They reinforce Kael’s floating stability.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Measured, focused, and contemplative. Their communication involves subtle pulse-changes that correspond to emotional or environmental states.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: energy amplification, environmental correction, high endurance in active skyflow.  
Weaknesses: instability in static air, resonance turbulence during skyflow collapse, physically fragile outside sky-aligned zones.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Subtypes vary by pulse frequency, resonance intensity, and skyflow tolerance.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Aetherpulse integrate well with scholars, navigators, and atmospheric specialists, but may appear overly detached to more grounded species.
