# Aetheri (Elementari Skyflow Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Aetheri form the skyflow-aligned Elementari branch, characterized by semi-aeriform physiology and resonance systems attuned to atmospheric currents. Their bodies incorporate low-density energy membranes, pressure-sensitive conduits, and microflow channels that interact directly with Kael’s airborne environment. They represent the most atmospheric-responsive Elementari lineage.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Aetheri exhibit soft distortion halos, drifting motion patterns, and posture that subtly aligns with prevailing winds. Their silhouettes may blur slightly during movement, and coloration shifts faintly with atmospheric pressure. They maintain fluid, buoyant gestures.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Aetheri resonance activates through interaction with skyflow currents, producing controlled pressure shifts, directional airflow modulation, or localized turbulence redirection. Their resonance is strongest in open-air environments with significant atmospheric motion.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit floating ridges, skyplateaus, wind corridors, and regions along Kael’s atmospheric drift. Aetheri help regulate skyflow balance, redirect turbulent pockets, and maintain open-air stability across high-altitude zones.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social behavior favors motion-synchronization, adaptive communication patterns, and collective sensory attunement. Aetheri groups make decisions based on shared atmospheric perception rather than verbal dialogue.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: exceptional mobility, skyflow manipulation, acute environmental awareness, low-density endurance.  
Weaknesses: severe instability in underground or enclosed areas, resonance collapse in stagnant air, vulnerability to vacuum or sudden pressure changes.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three major Aetheri subtypes exist: Skylink (pure skyflow integration), Zephyrite (pressure/wind alignment), and Aetherpulse (energy-node resonance). Each expresses different aspects of atmospheric force.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Aetheri integrate well with species comfortable in open-air environments. Species relying on solid grounding may find their buoyancy or drift-pattern movement disorienting.
