# Zephyrite (Aetheri Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Zephyrites specialize in atmospheric pressure manipulation and wind resonance. Their physiology incorporates flexible energy membranes capable of rapid expansion and contraction in response to pressure gradients.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They maintain oscillating posture, with faint ripple effects around their limbs. Movements are sharp and responsive, often marked by brief gust-like bursts.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Zephyrite resonance produces controlled pressure shifts, localized gusts, and wind pulse bursts. Their abilities excel in high-wind zones and rapid atmospheric transitions.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit wind corridors, storm ridgelines, and high-pressure sky channels. Zephyrites assist in equalizing pressure zones across airborne ecosystems.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Direct and kinetic communicators. Group dynamics follow airflow rhythm, with quick shifts in tone and posture mirroring wind change.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: pressure modulation, rapid displacement, environmental adaptability.  
Weaknesses: instability in low-pressure voids, resonance overload in confined areas.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variation appears in gust output, frequency modulation, and pressure spike tolerance.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Zephyrites interact well in fast-paced environments but may overwhelm quieter species with sudden aero-resonant motion.
