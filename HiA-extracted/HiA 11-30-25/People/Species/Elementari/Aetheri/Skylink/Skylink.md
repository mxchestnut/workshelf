# Skylink (Aetheri Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Skylink Aetheri embody pure atmospheric interaction, with bodies composed of lightweight energy structures optimized for seamless merging with skyflow currents. Their resonance displays the most direct connection with Kael’s natural drift.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They appear semi-translucent, often trailing soft vapor-like ribbons. Movement patterns are fluid, with directional shifts matching wind vectors even without conscious effort.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Skylink resonance enables precise airflow modulation, skyflow reading, and microcurrent shaping. They can guide or disperse turbulent pockets with minimal energy expenditure.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit open skyfields, high spires, floating archipelagos, and drift corridors. Skylinks serve as natural stabilizers for floating terrain.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Highly adaptive and synchronistic, often coordinating with group movement instinctively. They prefer unstructured, open social groups.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: unmatched skyflow sensitivity, high mobility, efficient airflow control.  
Weaknesses: extreme vulnerability in enclosed, stagnant, or underground environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include density, translucency, and drift-speed adaptation.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They excel in navigation roles but may appear unfocused or distant to ground-bound species.
