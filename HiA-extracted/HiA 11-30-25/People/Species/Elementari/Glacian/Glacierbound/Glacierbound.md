# Glacierbound (Glacian Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Glacierbound are dense, slow-moving Glacian whose physiology mirrors glacier ice—layered, heavy, and highly compressed. Their bodies consist of thick cryo-plates and reinforced substructures ideal for environmental endurance.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their movements are heavy, deliberate, and carry low-frequency rumbling. Surfaces exhibit layered ice patterns with trapped fractal inclusions.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Glacierbound resonance produces sustained cold fields rather than quick bursts. They specialize in stabilizing large-scale temperature zones or reinforcing frozen terrain.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit deep glacier caverns, ancient ice masses, and frozen mountain interiors. They regulate glacier drift and prevent deep-ice fractures.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Methodical and steady; communication is sparse but impactful. They form long-standing social bonds built on consistency.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: extreme durability, sustained cold output, environmental reinforcement.  
Weaknesses: very slow mobility, susceptibility to shattering under concentrated kinetic force, difficulty acclimating outside frozen terrain.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Differences appear in density, internal layering, and cryo-pressure capacity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They serve as stabilizers or guardians in cross-species communities but may be too slow-paced for fast-moving groups.
