# Frostborn (Glacian Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Frostborn exemplify pure ice resonance, with bodies composed of stable frost-crystal structures and reinforced cryogenic conduits. They maintain consistently low internal temperatures and display high resistance to subzero environments.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their surfaces shimmer with crystalline frost, and movement produces faint crackling sounds. Frostborn hold poised, angular posture, mirroring fractal ice geometry.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their resonance generates sharp, rapid cold bursts capable of freezing localized surfaces. Activation peaks in deep winter conditions or near strong cryo sources.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in glacial fields, permanent ice caverns, and polar ridges. They contribute to stabilizing permafrost layers and preventing catastrophic ice collapse.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Reserved, still, and highly observant. Frostborn favor structured environments and avoid sudden emotional or environmental change.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: intense cold projection, high durability in frozen settings, precision freezing.  
Weaknesses: brittleness under heat exposure, fragile resonance near open flames, slow recovery in warm climates.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include crystal clarity, frost density, and cold emission pattern.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They integrate well with cold-adapted species but struggle in warm settlements.
