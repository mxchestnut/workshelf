# Glacian (Elementari Ice Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Glacian represent the ice-aligned Elementari branch, defined by cryothermal physiology and resonance structures adapted for cold environments. Their bodies incorporate frost-crystal matrices and temperature-regulating conduits capable of storing and releasing controlled cold energy. Glacian variants reflect different forms of ice ecology, from crystalline stability to phase-shift responsiveness.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Glacian exhibit visible frost accumulation along limbs, slow vapor plumes during respiration, and reflective crystalline surfaces. Their movements tend toward measured, deliberate pacing, with posture emphasizing minimal energy expenditure. Body temperature is significantly lower than humanoid norms.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Glacian resonance activates through ambient cold or contact with frozen material. Awakening enhances internal cryo-conduction pathways, enabling them to generate freezing bursts, temperature drains, or localized frostfields. Resonance destabilizes quickly in warm environments.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit tundras, frost caverns, high-altitude icefields, and shadowed polar zones. Glacian regulate thermal balance in their ecosystems, slow rapid melts, and prevent cryo-structural collapse in frozen environments.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social behavior is calm, steady, and introspective. Glacian groups emphasize patience, stability, and predictable emotional landscapes. Communication often incorporates subtle shifts in glow temperature or crystalline resonance tones.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: cold generation, high environmental endurance in frozen terrain, resistance to thermal fluctuation.  
Weaknesses: vulnerability to heat, resonance degradation in warm climates, structural brittleness under sudden thermal shock.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three primary Glacian subtypes exist: Frostborn (pure ice), Glacierbound (dense ice-mass humanoids), and Wintermelt (ice-steam phase-shifters). Variants differ by temperature range, crystalline density, and fluidity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Glacian interact effectively with species tolerant of low temperatures. Heat-reliant species may experience discomfort or resonance interference around them.
