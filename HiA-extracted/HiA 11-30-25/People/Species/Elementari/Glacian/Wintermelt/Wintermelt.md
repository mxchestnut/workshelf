# Wintermelt (Glacian Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Wintermelt represent a rare phase-shift variant within the Glacian branch capable of cycling between ice and vapor states. Their physiology incorporates pressure-reactive crystal structures that release steam under controlled conditions.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They exhibit alternating vapor plumes and frost blooms, with posture that shifts dynamically between rigid and fluid. Their movements are more adaptive compared to other Glacian.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their resonance enables rapid phase transitions—producing freezing mist, condensed frostflurries, or controlled temperature oscillations. They excel at environmental adaptation and short-range concealment.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in wet tundras, snowy hot springs, and geothermal-frost convergence zones. They help regulate meltwater cycles and reduce destructive thaw patterns.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Flexible, responsive, and socially adaptive. Wintermelt act as intermediaries between colder and warmer species due to their variable temperature range.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: phase-shift capability, fog creation, temperature modulation.  
Weaknesses: unstable resonance under extreme dry cold or high heat, high energy cost for transformation cycles.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variability appears in steam density, frost condensation rate, and transformation speed.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They adapt well to mixed communities and serve effectively in reconnaissance or environmental balancing roles.
