# Elementari (Parent Species)

## 1. Species Summary
The Elementari are a multispectral elemental species whose biology integrates environmental energy sources directly into their physiology. Each individual expresses a dominant elemental alignment—air, water, stone, light, etc.—that shapes their internal resonance, morphology, and ecological role. The species is highly adaptive, with stable branches emerging from Kael’s diverse elemental landscapes.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Elementari exhibit physical traits reflecting their elemental alignment, including coloration patterns, glow signatures, surface textures, and movement styles. Body language varies by branch but typically incorporates fluid resonance cues—light shifts, tonal fluctuations, airflow pulses, or mineral vibrations. Their gestures tend to mirror natural forces associated with their subtype.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Elementari resonance arises from alignment between internal conduits and environmental energy fields. Awakening typically occurs in elementally rich areas and manifests as increased elemental emission: light pulses, airflow distortions, heat radiance, or mineral harmonic responses. Resonance stability depends on proximity to compatible terrain or atmospheric conditions.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Each Elementari subspecies thrives in environments matching its dominant element. Aeralis inhabit wind corridors and aquatic zones; Luminari dwell in high-illumination regions; Geonari anchor themselves within stone, ore, and volcanic habitats. They help regulate elemental flow across Kael’s floating ecosystem, stabilizing natural forces through resonance interaction.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Elementari communities favor cohesion, resonance harmony, and environmental attunement. Social structures are shaped by elemental compatibility rather than lineage alone. They navigate group dynamics through tonal communication, light flux, or rhythmic motion depending on branch. Conflict is uncommon due to resonance feedback causing environmental stress.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths include high environmental adaptability within their element, enhanced sensory perception, and physical or energetic traits tied to their alignment. Weaknesses include vulnerability outside compatible environments, resonance destabilization under opposing elemental forces, and fatigue when overextending elemental output.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three major branches currently recognized: Aeralis (air-water-sound), Luminari (light), and Geonari (earth-metal-crystal-fire). Each contains multiple stable subspecies with non-overlapping traits. Additional branches may exist where elemental domains remain underrepresented.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Elementari interact well with species capable of interpreting their resonance cues. They may appear unnerving or overstimulating to species highly sensitive to light, sound, heat, or density changes. Their environmental impact requires careful integration in mixed settlements.
