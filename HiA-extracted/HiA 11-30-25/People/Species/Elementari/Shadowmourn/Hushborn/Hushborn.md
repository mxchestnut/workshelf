# Hushborn (Shadowmourn Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Hushborn specialize in silence-based resonance, with physiology designed to absorb, nullify, or redirect sound waves. Their bodies contain vibration-dampening tissues and ultralow-frequency energy matrices.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They move with complete noiselessness, and gestures appear soft, slow, and deliberate. Areas around them may fall unnaturally quiet due to passive resonance bleed.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Hushborn resonance suppresses sound, creating silence fields or nullifying incoming vibrations. They excel at controlling auditory environments and masking movement.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in deep caverns, quiet groves, abandoned structures, and still valleys. They maintain balance in delicate nocturnal ecosystems by preventing disruptive noise buildup.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Highly introspective and subtle, using touch, visual cues, and resonance pulses for communication. They value calm, stillness, and emotional stability.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: exceptional silence production, sound nullification, vibration control.  
Weaknesses: weakened in chaotic or noisy environments, destabilized by sonic overload, limited communication options with non-resonant species.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include silence radius, dampening intensity, and vibration-sensing clarity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They integrate well into stealth-focused groups but may unintentionally create discomfort by suppressing natural environmental sound.
