# Shadowmourn (Elementari Shadow Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Shadowmourn form the shadow-aligned Elementari branch, defined by photonegative physiology and resonance that manipulates dim light, obscurity, and silence. Their bodies incorporate low-luminosity energy membranes, umbral conduits, and light-absorptive surfaces that interact with dusk-spectrum wavelengths. Shadowmourn variants excel at sensory masking, shadow manipulation, and low-frequency resonance dampening.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Shadowmourn show diffuse darkening around their silhouettes, subdued coloration, and movement patterns that blur under low light. Their gestures are minimal and fluid, often accompanied by soft dimming of ambient illumination. Their presence naturally reduces sound and visibility in subtle degrees.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Shadowmourn resonance activates through low-light conditions, silence, or interaction with photonegative energy sources. Activation produces controlled shadow shaping, noise dampening, or localized darkness fields. Resonance destabilizes in intense light environments or under sudden radiance bursts.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit deep forests, caverns, dusk plains, ruins, and twilight regions. Shadowmourn assist in balancing nocturnal ecosystems, stabilizing darkflow currents, and preventing harmful over-brightening in delicate habitats.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social patterns emphasize subtle communication, nonverbal cues, and emotional restraint. Shadowmourn communities operate through pulse-patterns, shadow-shifts, and quiet resonance signatures. They value discretion, observation, and controlled interaction.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: shadow blending, sensory dampening, stealth resonance, high adaptability in low-light zones.  
Weaknesses: vulnerability to bright light, destabilization during sudden luminosity shifts, limited endurance in sun-aligned environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three major Shadowmourn subtypes exist: Umbraveil (pure shadow alignment), Nightglint (reflective dusk), and Hushborn (silence-anchored). Each expresses a distinct aspect of shadow resonance.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Shadowmourn coexist comfortably with nocturnal or quiet species. They may unintentionally alarm species reliant on visibility or vocal communication.
