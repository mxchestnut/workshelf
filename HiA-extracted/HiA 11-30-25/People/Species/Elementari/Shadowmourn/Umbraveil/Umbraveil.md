# Umbraveil (Shadowmourn Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Umbraveil embody pure shadow resonance, with physiology composed of densely compressed umbral energy, soft-edged humanoid shapes, and low-reflective surfaces. They are the darkest-aligned Shadowmourn variant.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their silhouettes blur at the edges, and their features dim beyond easy recognition in low light. Movement resembles drifting shadows, with minimal footfall noise.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Umbraveil resonance produces controlled darkness fields, deep shadow casting, and the ability to merge seamlessly into low-light zones. They excel at concealment and environmental shadow manipulation.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit caverns, ruins, dense forests, and twilight valleys. They help regulate shadow density and prevent light oversaturation.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Quiet, reserved, and observant. Umbraveil rely heavily on spatial positioning and subtle gestures for communication.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: advanced shadow blending, strong dimming fields, exceptional stealth.  
Weaknesses: severe vulnerability to bright light, resonance fragmentation under intense illumination, difficulty adapting to daylight environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include shadow density, silhouette crispness, and darkness-field range.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Other species may find their presence eerie or disconcerting, though Umbraveil seldom intend harm.
