# Nightglint (Shadowmourn Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Nightglint represent a dusk-reflective Shadowmourn variant whose physiology incorporates faint light-capturing microcrystals. They manipulate limited-spectrum illumination rather than full shadow.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They display soft glitters or glimmers across dark surfaces, especially under moonlight. Movements are smooth but carry small flashes of dim reflection.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Nightglint resonance bends and redirects faint light, creating illusions, soft afterimages, or dim glare suppression. They excel at low-level visual manipulation.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Common in twilight plains, moonlit forests, and reflective stone regions. They regulate dusk-spectrum environments and help maintain nocturnal visibility balance.

## 5. Social Tendencies
More expressive than Umbraveil, using reflective glints as communication cues. Nightglint individuals often fill mediator roles.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: dusk-light control, visual distortion, subtle misdirection.  
Weaknesses: extremely limited ability in total darkness, destabilization under strong light sources.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include reflection sharpness, sparkle density, and dusk-intensity tolerance.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They interact well with species comfortable in night environments and may fascinate species drawn to luminous patterns.
