# Cinderkin (Pyronari Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Cinderkin Pyronari represent a smoke-and-ember variant adapted to lower-temperature combustion. Their physiology incorporates smoldering carbon structures and particulate resonance membranes.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They emit faint smoke trails during exertion, and their movements stir ash-like motes from their surface. Their posture is loose and drifting, echoing smoke behavior.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Cinderkin resonance generates smoldering heat and particulate waves instead of open flame. They excel at infiltration heat, passive smothering warmth, and ember-spread resonance.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Common in burned forests, ember plains, and volcanic ash belts. They assist in soil renewal and ash dispersal following fires.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Calm and contemplative, with slow, drifting gestures mirroring smoke flow. They value quiet, controlled movement and low-energy interaction.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: stealth-compatible heat signatures, high particulate resistance, ember manipulation.  
Weaknesses: limited flame output, instability in wind-heavy regions, vulnerability to rapid extinguishing.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include smoke density, ember coloration, and particulate spread capacity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Well-suited to coexist with species sensitive to bright light, but may cause discomfort to those with respiratory vulnerabilities.
