# Pyronari (Elementari Fire Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Pyronari represent the fire-aligned Elementari branch, characterized by thermoreactive physiology and sustained combustion-based resonance. Their bodies incorporate mutable heat channels and ember-like tissues capable of generating, storing, and releasing thermal energy. Pyronari variants differ by temperature range, combustion form, and energetic output.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Pyronari exhibit heat shimmer around the skin, fluctuating ember tones, and crackling resonance under emotional or environmental stimulus. Their posture tends toward outward projection, with movements that emphasize force and directional flow. Subtle sparks or smoke traces may accompany rapid motion.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Pyronari resonance initiates through thermal alignment with active heat sources, such as flame, volcanic vents, or intense sunlight. Activation increases internal temperature, accelerates metabolic output, and enables controlled emission of fire or heat signatures. Resonance stability depends on maintaining thermal equilibrium.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They thrive in volcanic ridges, desert plains, ember fields, and sun-scorched highlands. Pyronari serve ecological roles in regulating thermal zones, preventing uncontrolled wildfires, and maintaining volcanic heat balance.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Pyronari communities favor decisive, direct interaction. Social groups revolve around heat-sharing patterns and synchronized energy discharge. They display high emotional intensity and strong protective instincts toward compatible Elementari branches.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: heat generation, rapid energy output, high resistance to combustion and volcanic hazards.  
Weaknesses: instability in cold or damp environments, risk of overheating when resonance is overextended, vulnerability to sudden temperature drop or heat siphons.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three recognized Pyronari subtypes exist: Flareborn (pure flame), Cinderkin (smoke/ember), and Plasmir (plasma/lightning fusion). These variants differ in temperature range, combustion form, and sensory patterns.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Pyronari integrate best with species accustomed to high heat or energetic intensity. They may overwhelm delicate or moisture-reliant species and must moderate thermal output in mixed environments.
