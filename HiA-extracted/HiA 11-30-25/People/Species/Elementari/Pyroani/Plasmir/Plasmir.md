# Plasmir (Pyronari Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Plasmir Pyronari are high-energy hybrids whose physiology produces superheated ionized particles. Their bodies maintain plasma channels capable of interacting with lightning and extreme photothermal energy.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They exhibit bright, flickering arcs of blue-white plasma and rapid, electricity-laced movements. Their posture reflects constant charge buildup and rapid discharge readiness.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Plasmir resonance fuses fire and lightning, generating explosive bursts, piercing photonic emission, or cutting arcs of plasma. They possess the highest energy output of the Pyronari.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Often found in volcanic storm regions, charged deserts, and skyflow-electrical convergence zones. They help disperse excessive energetic buildup and prevent atmospheric overload.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Fast-paced, intensely reactive, and highly expressive. They rely on charge pulses and high-frequency resonance bursts for communication.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: unmatched destructive potential, rapid discharge, strong resistance to electrical damage.  
Weaknesses: highly unstable in calm or low-energy environments, risk of uncontrolled discharge, severe fatigue after overexertion.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include plasma color, charge stability, and arc intensity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They may be dangerous to unshielded species due to stray discharge; best integrated into high-energy communities or specialized environments.
