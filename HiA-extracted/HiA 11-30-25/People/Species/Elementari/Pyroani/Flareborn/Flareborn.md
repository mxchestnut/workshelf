# Flareborn (Pyronari Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Flareborn Pyronari embody pure flame resonance, with bodies composed of semi-stable photothermal structures and high-temperature plasma sheaths. They exhibit continuous, low-level combustion across their outer layers.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their forms radiate constant warmth, and flames may flicker along arms or shoulders during movement. Posture is upright and force-oriented, and eye luminescence resembles burning embers.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Flareborn resonance produces steady flame output capable of illumination, heat projection, or controlled ignition. They excel at rapid ignition response and high-temperature bursts.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They dwell in volcanic zones, fire plains, and desert regions where combustible material is abundant. They help regulate wildfire dynamics through controlled burns.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Bold, expressive, and highly energetic. They use sharp, flame-like gestures and rely on temperature fluctuations for subtle communication.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: intense heat output, rapid ignition, flame shaping.  
Weaknesses: extreme susceptibility to cold dampening, instability during prolonged resonance, high energy demand.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include flame color, ignition threshold, and burn-duration traits.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They may intimidate species sensitive to heat or brightness and require caution in flammable environments.
