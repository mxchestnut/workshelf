# Crystalvein (Kairathi Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Crystalvein Kairathi form in regions rich in crystalline matrices and mineral lattices. Their bodies incorporate transparent or semi-transparent crystalline structures that refract light and energy.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They exhibit refractive glints and prism-like reflections across their surfaces. Movements are precise and angled, mirroring crystalline geometry.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their resonance aligns internal crystal networks to channel, store, or refract energetic input. Activation amplifies clarity, stability, and limited energy focusing.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Common in crystal caverns, mineral spires, and geode forests. They naturally regulate crystal growth patterns and prevent echo-harmonic buildup in resonant caves.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They display analytical, measured social patterns and value clarity in communication. Groups organize around geometric precision and structural harmony.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: energy focusing, light refraction, structural rigidity, high resistance to sonic distortion.  
Weaknesses: brittleness under sharp impact, susceptibility to thermal shock, limited flexibility.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Crystalvein individuals vary in clarity, fracture pattern, and refractive index. Some develop soft internal luminescence under resonance activation.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They interact smoothly in environments valuing order and structure. Their precise communication style may be misread as aloof in fluid or highly emotional groups.
