# Stormcarved (Kairathi Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Stormcarved Kairathi form in regions where mineral deposits are repeatedly exposed to electrical storms or static-heavy atmospheres. Their bodies incorporate metallic filaments and conductive seams, granting enhanced responsiveness to atmospheric charge.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They exhibit subtle arc-flashes along joints during movement and maintain heightened alertness during electrical buildup. Their skin carries metallic sheen patterns that brighten under storm activity.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Stormcarved resonance calibrates mineral structures to channel electrical energy safely. Activation enhances reflex speed and electrical resistance while stabilizing surrounding charge differentials.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found on storm ridges, charged plains, and metallic outcroppings exposed to frequent lightning. They help discharge accumulated static fields, reducing storm volatility around Kairathi settlements.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Stormcarved individuals display fast decision cycles and strong situational awareness. They often adopt sentry or scout roles within Kairathi communities.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: electrical resistance, rapid reflexes, conductive energy management.  
Weaknesses: reduced performance in electrically inert zones, vulnerability to ground-discharge traps, brittle mineral seams under abrupt thermal shifts.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations occur in filament density, conductivity level, and lightning tolerance. Some rare individuals emit faint electrical crackle under stress.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They work well with species adapted to storm or high-energy zones, though their sudden reactive responses may unsettle calmer populations.
