# Ashforged (Kairathi Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Ashforged are a volcanic Kairathi subspecies formed through exposure to intense heat, ash saturation, and molten mineral flows. Their bodies exhibit cracked obsidian-like surfaces with internal ember glows corresponding to thermal energy regulation.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their skin displays glowing fissures that brighten under stress or exertion. Movement produces soft puffs of ash or emberlike sparks. Their posture is direct and heat-oriented, often gravitating toward warm zones.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Awakening occurs in proximity to volcanic activity, where ash and mineral particulates catalyze internal restructuring. The process enhances thermal retention, combustion resistance, and controlled heat emission.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Ashforged thrive in volcanic ridges, geothermal vents, and ember plains. They regulate heat dispersion and often assist in managing lava-flow deviations around settlements.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They are more intense and decisive than other Kairathi subspecies, exhibiting faster reaction cycles and strong territorial instincts around heat sources. Their communities often form near active volcanic features.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: high-temperature tolerance, heat emission capability, resistance to flame or molten hazards.  
Weaknesses: brittleness at low temperatures, difficulty functioning in damp or cold environments, overexertion leading to thermal instability.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variation includes ember coloration, crack pattern distribution, and temperature thresholds. Some rare variants display low-level internal combustion.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Ashforged interact well with species adapted to harsh climates or high activity levels but may intimidate more fragile species due to their heat emissions and intense demeanor.
