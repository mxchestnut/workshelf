# Stoneborn (Kairathi Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Stoneborn represent the most common Kairathi subspecies, characterized by granite-like skin, compact musculature, and high structural density. Their physiology reflects classic stone composition, granting exceptional endurance and environmental stability.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their movements are steady and grounded, producing minimal noise despite their density. Skin coloration resembles granite or basalt, often with natural veining patterns. Body language relies on stance shifts rather than facial markers.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Stoneborn awaken when exposed to significant lithic pressure or stone-rich environments. Their resonance strengthens skeletal and dermal mineral structures, increasing durability and stabilizing internal energy flow.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Most common in mountains, plateaus, and deep-mineral forests. Stoneborn help maintain structural integrity in quarry settlements and naturally reinforce compromised stone environments.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They show preference for predictable routines, strong communal roles, and long-term projects. Stoneborn serve as builders, guardians, and logistical anchors in Kairathi society.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: extreme durability, long endurance, high resistance to pressure or impact.  
Weaknesses: slow acceleration, difficulty adapting to rapid environmental changes, susceptibility to targeted shattering techniques.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Coloration and density vary by region of origin. Some Stoneborn show minor crystalline inclusions or sedimentary layering traits.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They interact reliably with others but may appear emotionally distant. Their stability makes them valued defensive or structural specialists.
