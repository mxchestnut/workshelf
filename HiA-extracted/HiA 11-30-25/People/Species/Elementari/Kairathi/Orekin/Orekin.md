# Orekin (Kairathi Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Orekins are metal-rich Kairathi formed in deep-vein ore regions. Their bodies contain metallic alloys integrated into bone and dermal layers, producing enhanced strength and magnetic responsiveness.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Movement produces low metallic resonance. Their posture is rigid and weight-focused, and their skin often exhibits ore coloration—copper, iron, silver, or mixed alloys.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their awakening aligns internal metal veins to conduct structural energy effectively. This increases strength, mass-reinforcement, and limited magnetic attunement.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Orekins inhabit deep mines, ore caverns, and metalliferous cliffsides. They stabilize mineral extraction shafts by reinforcing weakened nodes or redirecting magnetic strain.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They value precision, stability, and long-term planning. Their social behavior is pragmatic, with strong loyalty to group infrastructure projects.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: high structural strength, metal manipulation aptitude, resistance to crushing force.  
Weaknesses: susceptibility to corrosion in harsh environments, over-magnetization near strong fields, reduced agility.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Subtypes differ in dominant ore type and alloy composition. Rare variants exhibit trace conductive or reflective properties.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Orekins collaborate effectively in construction or metallurgical roles but may appear overly rigid or literal in mixed-species settings.
