# Kairathi (Parent Species)

## 1. Species Summary
The Kairathi are a geomorphic humanoid species whose physiology incorporates mineral matrices, metallic deposits, and crystalline structures. Their bodies form through a fusion of organic tissue and lithic matter, producing exceptional durability, slow metabolic turnover, and environmental resilience. Subspecies arise from geological zones, each shaped by its native mineral composition.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Kairathi exhibit reduced micro-expressions due to mineralized facial structure, relying instead on posture shifts, grounding stances, and controlled gestures. Subtle grinding or resonant hums may occur during movement. Their body weight is significantly higher than humanoid averages due to internal density.

## 3. Resonance / Awakening Summary
Awakening occurs when mineral structures align with internal energy pathways, typically in geologically active or symbolically charged locations. Manifestations vary by subspecies but often include increased density, thermal emission, or structural hardening. The process is physically strenuous but stable once complete.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Kairathi are native to stone-dominant regions—mountain ranges, volcanic ridges, crystalline caverns, and mineral forests. They regulate geological energy flow and often stabilize tectonic microfractures through subtle resonance conduction. Ecosystem dynamics position them as anchors within mineral-heavy environments.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They favor highly stable social structures with slow decision-making processes and generational continuity. Communication is deliberate, emphasizing reliability and long-term planning. Their communities form around quarry-cities, ridge-settlements, and crystal sanctuaries.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths include extreme durability, resistance to environmental hazards, and consistent long-term labor or planning capacity. Weaknesses include low agility, vulnerability to shattering forces or high-frequency vibrations, and difficulty adapting to rapid environmental change.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Subspecies derive from specific geological influences—stone, volcanic ash, crystal, ore, and more. Variances appear in coloration, density, elemental affinity, and thermal regulation. Mixed-subspecies traits do not blend; offspring express a dominant geological lineage.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Kairathi integrate best with species valuing stability, craftsmanship, and resource stewardship. They can appear stoic or unreactive to species that rely on expressive cues, but form deeply loyal bonds once trust is established.
