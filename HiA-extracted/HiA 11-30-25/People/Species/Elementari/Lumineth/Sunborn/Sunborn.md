# Sunborn (Lumineth Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Sunborn Lumineth resonate with solar light, storing and converting high-intensity illumination into sustained radiance and physical enhancement. Their bodies incorporate golden photonic lattices that amplify under direct sunlight.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They display warm, steady luminescence and maintain upright, open posture. Sunborn skin often carries amber or gold undertones. Their presence radiates heat and low-level illumination.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Sunborn resonance produces concentrated, steady photonic output—ideal for illumination, stabilization, and regenerative functions. Their resonance peaks during daylight hours.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit sun-drenched plains, high plateaus, and regions with minimal shade. They help regulate thermal and photic balance in their ecosystems.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Optimistic, warm, and steady communicators. Sunborn form highly supportive social networks with reliable emotional consistency.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: sustained energy reserves, healing illumination, broad-spectrum radiance.  
Weaknesses: reduced capability in deep shade, night conditions, or under cloud cover; risk of overexertion under prolonged direct solar overload.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include light warmth, photonic intensity, and solar absorption efficiency.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Easily integrated into mixed-species communities, though some may find their warmth or brightness overwhelming.
