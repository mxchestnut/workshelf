# Lumineth (Parent Species)

## 1. Species Summary
The Lumineth are an energy-adaptive humanoid species whose physiology incorporates photonic particles, bioluminescent tissues, and light-responsive structures. Their bodies resonate with external light sources—solar, lunar, stellar, or atmospheric—producing distinct subtype specializations. They exhibit controlled radiance, enhanced perception, and stable light modulation abilities.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Lumineth display soft internal glow patterns that intensify with emotional activation. Their movements are smooth and fluid, with subtle radiance trails present during rapid motion. Eye luminescence shifts according to resonance state, and their skin exhibits reflective or refractive qualities depending on subtype.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their resonance is photonic, activating through alignment with ambient light sources. Early resonance displays minor glows or flickers, while full activation produces controlled light emission, pulse bursts, or harmonic illumination. Resonance stability increases in environments rich in their associated light spectrum.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Lumineth thrive in regions with consistent natural illumination—open plains, mountain ridges, starlit fields, and high atmosphere zones. They contribute to ecological balance by diffusing concentrated light energy and stabilizing photonic anomalies in their environment.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social structures emphasize clarity, harmony, and emotional transparency. Lumineth typically form cohesive communities with predictable routines and strong inter-member attunement. Their communication incorporates subtle shifts in light flux and tonal coloration.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths include heightened perception, radiance manipulation, and adaptability within their specific light domain. Weaknesses include instability in light-deprived environments, susceptibility to energetic overextension, and resonance distortion under artificial light.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Four primary subtypes exist—Stormlight, Sunborn, Moonveil, and Starweaver—each bound to a specific photonic spectrum. Variations occur in glow intensity, light focus, and resonance waveforms. Subtype traits do not blend across lineages.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Lumineth integrate well with species comfortable around brightness and emotional openness. Species sensitive to light or sudden illumination may find Lumineth presence overstimulating.
