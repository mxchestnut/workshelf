# Moonveil (Lumineth Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Moonveil Lumineth resonate with reflected or indirect light, including moonlight, low-intensity glows, and ambient atmospheric shimmer. Their physiology emphasizes subtle luminescence and soft-spectrum harmonics.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their glow is gentle and diffused, often appearing silvery or blue-toned. Movements are slow, flowing, and visually calming. Eye radiance softens rather than intensifies under activation.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Moonveil resonance produces low-intensity light waves optimized for clarity, emotional stabilization, and perceptual enhancement. Strongest during dusk, night, or low-light conditions.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They dominate coastal cliffs, reflective plains, and quiet highlands. They help regulate nighttime illumination and atmospheric reflection patterns.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Reserved, observant, and gentle communicators. Moonveil groups emphasize calm emotional environments and intuitive understanding.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: night vision enhancement, emotional clarity, subtle radiance control.  
Weaknesses: poor performance under harsh or direct light; resonance destabilization during sudden brightness shifts.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include glow softness, wavelength spread, and nocturnal sensitivity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They integrate best with calmer species and may struggle around loud, brightly lit, or fast-moving communities.
