# Stormlight (Lumineth Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Stormlight Lumineth resonate with high-energy atmospheric illumination produced by storms, lightning, and turbulent skyflow. Their physiology incorporates charged photonic strands, enabling them to interact with dynamic weather patterns.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They exhibit flickering bands of blue-white radiance across their skin, especially around joints. Movement is sharp and reactive, mirroring storm activity. Their eyes often display electrical veining during resonance activation.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Stormlight resonance generates rapid pulses of charged light capable of stabilizing or dispersing atmospheric tension. Activation is strongest during storm events and weakest in still air.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found along stormbelts, high cliffs, and regions prone to electrical skyflow. They serve as natural stabilizers for charged light energy.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Direct, fast-paced communicators with heightened situational awareness. Group coordination mimics electrical chain-reaction patterns.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: high-output illumination, resistance to electrical discharge, rapid sensory processing.  
Weaknesses: low performance in tranquil environments, instability in enclosed spaces, resonance agitation without atmospheric charge.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Differences occur in charge threshold, pulse intensity, and lightning affinity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They function well alongside high-energy species but may overstimulate calmer or nocturnal populations.
