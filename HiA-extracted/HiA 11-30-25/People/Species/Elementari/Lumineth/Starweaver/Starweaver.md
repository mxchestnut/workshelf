# Starweaver (Lumineth Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Starweaver Lumineth resonate with stellar light and high-altitude radiation. Their bodies incorporate micro-crystalline photonic threads that respond to distant celestial illumination with subtle, pulsing radiance.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They exhibit shimmering, constellation-like points of light across the skin. Their movements feel weightless, and their gaze reflects faint star-like flickers.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Starweaver resonance attunes to faint cosmic light, producing directional pulses, clarity bursts, or micro-luminescent fields. They are strongest under clear night skies.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in high mountains, star-observatory regions, and quiet night plains. They assist in dispersing celestial resonance buildup across Kael’s atmosphere.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Reflective, thoughtful, and patient communicators. Starweavers emphasize contemplation and long-term perspective in group structures.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: pinpoint-focus illumination, cosmic resonance detection, high-altitude adaptation.  
Weaknesses: weakened in clouded, enclosed, or heavily polluted areas; resonance interference during solar storms.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variability appears in star-pattern distribution, intensity, and resonance wavelength.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They cooperate well in scholarly or observational communities but may seem distant to highly grounded or fast-paced species.
