# Sylvari (Elementari Nature Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Sylvari form the nature-aligned Elementari branch, characterized by plant-integrated physiology and growth-responsive resonance. Their bodies incorporate organic fiber structures, bioluminescent chlorophyll channels, and adaptive cellulose matrices capable of regeneration and environmental blending. Sylvari variants express distinct ecological functions tied to forest, meadow, or deep-root biomes.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Sylvari display plantlike traits such as vine-like musculature, leaf or petal formations, and rhythmic micro-movements that mimic botanical growth patterns. Their posture is fluid and grounded, often shifting subtly with local light, humidity, or soil composition.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Sylvari resonance activates through exposure to natural growth cycles—sunlight, rainfall, soil nutrients, or ambient biomagnetic fields. Activation increases regenerative capacity, enhances sensory perception of living systems, and enables controlled growth manipulation. Resonance weakens in polluted or barren areas.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Sylvari inhabit forests, prairies, root networks, and humid glades. They contribute to soil enrichment, plant propagation, and ecological stabilization. Their presence accelerates natural recovery in damaged ecosystems.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social patterns prioritize harmony, mutual support, and cyclic routine. Sylvari communities operate through shared sensory blending, with collective decision-making influenced by group-wide environmental perception.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: regeneration, environmental blending, growth-based sensory mapping, toxin filtration.  
Weaknesses: vulnerability to fire, rapid decay in corrupted or barren soils, resonance disruption from chemical or arcane pollutants.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three major Sylvari subtypes exist: Rootwoven (deep-growth), Bloomshapers (surface-growth), and Verdanthorn (defensive-growth). Each expresses specialized plant adaptations and corresponding resonance behaviors.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Sylvari interact well with species that maintain ecological balance. They may distrust fire-aligned or destructive entities due to instinctive defensive responses.
