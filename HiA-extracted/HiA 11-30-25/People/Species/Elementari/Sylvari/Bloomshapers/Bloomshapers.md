# Bloomshapers (Sylvari Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Bloomshapers specialize in surface-growth resonance, featuring petal-like structures, pollen dispersal membranes, and vibrant bioluminescent pigments. Their physiology optimizes rapid growth and regenerative bloom processes.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their movements are expressive and fluid, accompanied by shifting petals or spore flares. Bloomshapers often emit soft floral scents when resonating.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Bloomshaper resonance accelerates plant growth, produces healing spores, or emits pollen-based sensory fields. Their resonance is strongest under sunlight and during seasonal bloom cycles.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit meadows, glades, flowering forests, and high-illumination environments. Bloomshapers promote rapid ecosystem recovery and pollination balance.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Warm, expressive, and outwardly focused. They thrive in socially dynamic communities and act as nurturers or mediators.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: rapid regeneration, soothing bioluminescence, bloom manipulation.  
Weaknesses: vulnerability to toxins, decay, and parasitic blight; reduced performance in low-light environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include petal coloration, spore density, and bloom cycle timing.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Highly compatible with most species, though pollen-sensitive individuals may experience discomfort.
