# Verdanthorn (Sylvari Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Verdanthorn are defensive-growth Sylvari characterized by bark-plate armor, thorn ridges, and reinforced cellulose layers. Their physiology emphasizes protection, endurance, and physical deterrence.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They display hardened bark surfaces, thorn projections, and firm, grounded posture. Movements are deliberate, heavy, and protective in nature.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Verdanthorn resonance produces defensive growth patterns—rapid bark reinforcement, thorn extension, or controlled root barriers. They excel at shielding ecosystems and allies.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in dense forests, border thickets, and regions prone to predation or environmental stress. They help maintain territorial integrity through defensive growth.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Stoic and vigilant, preferring structured roles within Sylvari communities. Their communication is concise and direct.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: high durability, natural armor, area-control growth.  
Weaknesses: limited flexibility, increased vulnerability to fire, slow regeneration compared to Bloomshapers.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include thorn density, bark hardness, and growth-activation triggers.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They function well as protectors in diverse settlements but may appear imposing or overly rigid.
