# Rootwoven (Sylvari Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Rootwoven Sylvari embody deep-growth resonance, with physiology based on rootlike muscular lattice and subterranean sensory structures. They excel at maintaining long-term environmental stability through soil integration.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They display bark-like textures, trailing root filaments, and slow, grounded movements. Their posture remains low and centered, reflecting deep anchoring.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Rootwoven resonance extends through soil and plant networks, enabling long-range subterranean mapping, nutrient redirection, and stabilization of weakened terrain. Their resonance thrives in rich, undisturbed ground.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Common in ancient forests, root tunnels, and nutrient-dense earth layers. They maintain soil health and protect deep ecosystem infrastructure.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Patient, steady, and contemplative. They prefer roles that involve long-term caretaking or structural ecological maintenance.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: exceptional stability, soil integration, root-network communication.  
Weaknesses: poor mobility in non-soil environments, vulnerability to uprooting forces, difficulty adapting to rapid change.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include bark density, root reach, and nutrient absorption patterns.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Rootwoven serve as reliable guardians and ecological monitors in mixed-species regions, though their slow pace may be misunderstood as reluctance.
