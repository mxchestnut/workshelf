# Manaweave (Fluxborn Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Manaweave Fluxborn embody stable magical conduction, with bodies composed of interlaced mana filaments and structured resonance channels. They represent the most balanced and predictable Fluxborn subtype.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They display glowing threadlike markings across their limbs and torso. Movement is smooth and harmonious, often accompanied by soft luminescent pulses.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Manaweave resonance enhances spell clarity, reinforces magical structures, and stabilizes fluctuating arcane fields. They function as natural conduits or regulators for magical processes.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Common in leyline forests, stable arcane sanctuaries, and crystalline mana spires. They maintain mana flow and prevent stagnation or surge buildup.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Calm, logical, and highly cooperative. Manaweaves favor structured environments and collective resonance work.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: exceptional spell stability, mana channeling, arcane clarity.  
Weaknesses: limited offensive capability, resonance flutter under chaotic energy, susceptibility to patterns that disrupt mana flow.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include filament coloration, channel density, and resonance wavelength.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They are highly compatible with spellcasters and scholarly species, but may be overwhelmed by chaotic or loud social environments.
