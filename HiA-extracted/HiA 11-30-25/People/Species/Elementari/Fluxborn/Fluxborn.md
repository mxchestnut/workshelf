# Fluxborn (Elementari Arcane Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Fluxborn represent the arcane-aligned Elementari branch, formed from condensed magical resonance rather than physical matter. Their physiology incorporates unstable energy matrices, oscillating conduit threads, and spell-reactive filaments that allow them to interact directly with ambient magical fields. Fluxborn variants express different aspects of arcane behavior, from stable mana currents to volatile resonance storms.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Fluxborn exhibit fluctuating auras, luminous veining, and shifting geometric patterns across their surfaces. Their posture is fluid and responsive, often adjusting subconsciously to surrounding magical density. They may produce soft resonance tones or brief distortions during movement.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Fluxborn resonance activates through contact with arcane fields, leyline nodes, spell residue, or high-density mana sources. Activation generates spell-enhancing pulses, distortion effects, or raw energy bursts. Their resonance can destabilize under heavy emotional or environmental fluctuation.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit leyline intersections, arcane ruins, floating mana wells, and high-resonance caverns. Fluxborn regulate magical pressure, prevent resonance overload, and stabilize arcane anomalies within Kael’s drifting ecosystem.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social behavior is abstract, symbolic, and pattern-based. Fluxborn communicate through pulse-changes, geometric light patterns, and oscillation rhythms. Communities emphasize balance, harmony, and resonance management.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: magic amplification, resonance shaping, resistance to arcane instability.  
Weaknesses: physical fragility, extreme vulnerability to null-magic zones, risk of uncontrolled energy discharge under stress.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three major Fluxborn subtypes exist: Manaweave (stable magic conduction), Spellflux (volatile chaos energy), and Chronostem (temporal resonance variants). Each expresses distinct arcane properties.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Fluxborn coexist best with species familiar with magic. Species uncomfortable with magical phenomena may find their presence unpredictable or unnerving.
