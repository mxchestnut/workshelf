# Spellflux (Fluxborn Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Spellflux represent the chaotic end of the Fluxborn spectrum, embodying volatile magical resonance prone to sudden shifts. Their bodies consist of unstable energy patterns that fluctuate in intensity and shape.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They emit irregular flares, distortions, and flickering resonance. Their movements are unpredictable, rapid, and highly expressive, occasionally trailing arcane sparks.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Spellflux resonance produces chaotic magic bursts, distortion waves, and resonance storms. They excel at breaking stagnation, but require careful containment in sensitive environments.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found near unstable leyline fractures, magical stormfields, and recently collapsed arcane structures. They help dissipate dangerous magical buildup.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Energetic, impulsive, and intense. Communication relies on rapidly shifting pulse patterns and visual distortions.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: high energy output, disruptive power, unmatched resonance flexibility.  
Weaknesses: instability under emotional stress, risk of self-triggered energy surges, difficulty functioning in structured magical fields.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include burst intensity, distortion pattern, and arcane volatility.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They integrate best in groups comfortable with unpredictability. More delicate species may avoid them due to frequent microbursts of chaotic energy.
