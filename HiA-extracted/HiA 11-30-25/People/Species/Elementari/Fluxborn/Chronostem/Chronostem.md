# Chronostem (Fluxborn Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Chronostem Fluxborn embody temporal resonance, formed through exposure to time-distorting fields or ancient arcane anomalies. Their bodies integrate cyclical energy loops, phase-shift nodes, and rhythmic flux patterns that reflect temporal flow.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their presence creates subtle time-lag distortions, afterimages, or rhythmic flickering. Movements appear slightly offset or phase-shifted, and their posture is slow yet precise.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Chronostem resonance manipulates micro-scale temporal flow, producing brief slow-time fields, localized acceleration, or phase-delayed effects. Their resonance must remain tightly controlled to avoid destabilization.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit ancient ruins, temporal scars, chronal wells, and areas where time behaves anomalously. They help smooth temporal turbulence and reduce time-fracture risks.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Patient, introspective, and detached. Their communication mirrors time cycles—repetitive pulses, rhythmic patterns, and phased gestures.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: temporal perception, micro-scale time manipulation, strong immunity to time-distortion effects.  
Weaknesses: extreme vulnerability to paradox fields, instability under chaotic magic, difficulty interacting with fast-paced environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include phase clarity, cycle length, and time-loop intensity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Their presence may feel uncanny or disorienting. They integrate best with scholarly or contemplative species who tolerate slow communication patterns.
