# Gravemind (Gravitas Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Gravemind Gravitas specialize in density manipulation, capable of massively increasing their own weight or applying localized gravitational pressure. Their physiology features ultra-dense mineral cores and reinforced resonance channels.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They move with heavy, earth-shaking steps, and surfaces may crack slightly beneath them during activation. Their posture is low and braced, with limited but powerful gestures.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Gravemind resonance amplifies local gravity, generating crushing force, anchoring structures, or stabilizing tremor-prone terrain. Their resonance thrives in deep-earth environments.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Common along fault lines, sinkholes, and dense bedrock regions. They serve as natural anchors in high-risk seismic zones.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Serious, contemplative, and slow to react, but immensely dependable. Graveminds value predictability and long-term commitments.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: immense gravitational force, high durability, superior stability.  
Weaknesses: extremely slow mobility, resonance overheating in light or floating environments, difficulty with rapid movement.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include core density, anchoring range, and pressure-field intensity.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Highly protective but intimidating. They require careful integration into lightweight or skyborne communities.
