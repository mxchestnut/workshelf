# Lowfall (Gravitas Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Lowfall Gravitas manipulate directional gravity vectors, enabling temporary weightlessness or selective gravity reduction. Their bodies incorporate flexible resonance membranes tuned to gravitational variance.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They move with light, drifting steps, and their limbs often appear to lose and regain weight mid-motion. Lowfall individuals show subtle buoyancy pulses when excited.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Lowfall resonance modulates gravitational direction and intensity, allowing controlled levitation, gentle descent, or targeted gravity drops. Their abilities require stable environmental vectors.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found near floating plateaus, rift cliffs, and transitional gravity pockets. They regulate gravity shifts and help maintain the balance of suspended terrain.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Flexible, curious, and highly adaptive. They prefer dynamic social groups and fluid communication styles.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: levitation, directional gravity manipulation, enhanced agility.  
Weaknesses: instability near strong gravitic fields, resonance collapse under abrupt pressure changes, vulnerability in deep-earth environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variability includes lift-capacity, directional shift precision, and altitude endurance.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Lowfalls integrate easily with airborne species and explorers but may seem unpredictable to more grounded individuals.
