# Stonewake (Gravitas Subspecies)

## 1. Species Summary
Stonewake Gravitas convert internal density changes into seismic bursts, transmitting controlled vibrations through earth or stone. Their physiology incorporates shock-dampening layers and resonance chambers designed for oscillation.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Their stance is broad and braced, and their footsteps produce rhythmic tremors. During activation, their limbs vibrate visibly and surfaces around them ripple with seismic pulses.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Stonewake resonance generates directed shockwaves, tremors, or stabilization pulses. They excel at clearing unstable debris, reshaping terrain, or reinforcing weakened geological structures.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found in landslide zones, shifting ravines, and earthquake-prone areas. They regulate seismic energy and reduce catastrophic ground failure.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Steady, decisive, and responsive. They communicate through tone, vibration patterns, and rhythmic gestures.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: seismic manipulation, structural reinforcement, high resilience.  
Weaknesses: resonance disruption in waterlogged ground, reduced functionality in airborne areas, sensitivity to contradictory vibrational fields.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variations include quake amplitude, oscillation frequency, and vibration range.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They function well in groups requiring structural expertise or defense, though rhythmic tremors may unsettle delicate species.
