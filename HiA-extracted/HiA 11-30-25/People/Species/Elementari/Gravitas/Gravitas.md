# Gravitas (Elementari Gravity Branch)

## 1. Species Summary
The Gravitas form the gravity-aligned Elementari branch, characterized by density-reactive physiology and resonance structures that manipulate gravitational flow. Their bodies integrate pressure-adaptive mineral composites, mass-shifting conduits, and resonance anchors that stabilize or distort local gravity fields. Gravitas variants express unique combinations of weight control, seismic interaction, and directional gravity modulation.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Gravitas exhibit subtle spatial distortions around their limbs, increased ground pull during movement, and micro-vibrations that pulse with internal pressure changes. Their posture is grounded, heavy, and deliberate, with movements that emphasize controlled weight transfer. Some individuals produce faint ripple effects on nearby surfaces.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Gravitas resonance activates through contact with stable ground or tectonic energy sources. During activation, they manipulate gravitational vectors, increase or decrease their own density, or generate localized pressure fields. Resonance destabilizes in zero-gravity zones or airborne environments.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
They inhabit deep valleys, seismic plains, tectonic borders, and dense stone formations. Gravitas regulate fault tension, redirect seismic energy, and maintain ground stability around settlements. They play a critical role in preventing structural collapse in high-pressure environments.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Gravitas social behavior values stability, consistency, and firm boundaries. Their communities organize around pressure harmonics and shared seismic perception. Decision-making is methodical and long-term, often influenced by collective environmental awareness.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: gravity manipulation, density control, seismic awareness, extreme environmental resilience.  
Weaknesses: limitations in airborne regions, resonance collapse under rapid directional changes, difficulty adapting to high-speed or low-pressure environments.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Three major Gravitas subtypes exist: Gravemind (heavy-density manipulation), Lowfall (directional gravity-warp), and Stonewake (seismic-pressure hybrids). Each expresses a distinct gravitational specialization.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They interact best with species comfortable with slow, deliberate movement. Lightweight or airborne species may feel unsettled by Gravitas’ strong pull signatures or mass-shifting behaviors.
