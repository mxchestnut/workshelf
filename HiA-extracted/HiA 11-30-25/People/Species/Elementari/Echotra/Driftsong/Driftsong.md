# Driftsong (Echotra Subtype)

## 1. Species Summary
Driftsong Echotra are adapted to high-altitude and open-air environments where windflow remains consistent. Their semi-translucent structures are optimized for airflow resonance, allowing them to interpret subtle skyborne vibrations.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They maintain buoyant posture with light foot placement, and their hair or garments often move independently of local air currents. Their movements follow smooth aerodynamic arcs.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their resonance operates through windborne harmonics, producing faint whistle-tones and controlled airflow disturbances. Full expression allows precise manipulation of microcurrents and turbulence redirection.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Driftsong individuals inhabit skyfields, cliff ridges, and elevated plateaus. They regulate wind shear, disrupt echo buildup, and stabilize aerial resonance flows.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They prefer open environments and communicate through tonal rises resembling airflow shifts. Groups maintain directional positioning aligned with windflow.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: long-range resonance projection, aerial navigation, windflow detection.  
Weaknesses: enclosed spaces, heavy humidity, echo-dead structures.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variation occurs in pitch range and altitude-adaptation traits. Some produce near-ultrasonic harmonics.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They integrate well into scouting and navigation roles but may overwhelm quieter species with constant microtonal feedback.
