# Tidecallers (Echotra Subtype)

## 1. Species Summary
Tidecallers are water-resonant Echotra optimized for harmonic conduction through liquids. Their forms exhibit fluidic shimmer patterns along the skin and heightened sensitivity to flow dynamics.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Movements follow wave-like cadence, with arms and torso swaying subtly. Skin translucency increases in damp or humid environments.

## 3. Resonance Summary 
Their resonance operates through liquid medium, producing sounds reminiscent of surf, undertow, or river current. Full expression can alter water flow direction or smooth turbulence.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Found near rivers, wetlands, and echo-rich marshes. They harmonize aquatic drift patterns and reduce water-echo buildup.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Communicate with layered voices carrying faint ripple undertones. Group decisions follow gentle emotional gradients.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: fluid-echo mapping, amphibious sensory abilities, current tracking.  
Weaknesses: dry environments, chaotic storms, sonic shockwaves.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Variants differ by salinity adaptation and echo-medium preference.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Integrate easily in water-adjacent communities; often mediate disputes with calm vocal harmonics.
