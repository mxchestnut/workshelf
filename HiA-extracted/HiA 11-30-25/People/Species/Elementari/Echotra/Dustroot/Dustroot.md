# Dustroot (Echotra Subtype)

## 1. Species Summary
Dustroot Echotra are adapted to subterranean or hollow environments where low-frequency resonance dominates. Their bodies possess denser echo membranes to process deep vibrational signals.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
They move with steady, grounded steps and maintain low posture. Their presence produces faint vibration halos detectable in quiet environments.

## 3. Resonance Summary
Their resonance manifests as low-frequency pulses capable of mapping enclosed structures, detecting void pockets, and identifying subterranean instability.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Dustroot individuals dwell in caverns, ruins, deep rootsystems, and hollow forest floors. They maintain subterranean resonance balance and prevent echo buildup.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Quiet and analytical, they communicate through low hums and rhythmic pulses. Groups establish stable, echo-efficient formations.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: echo-mapping, void detection, subterranean navigation.  
Weaknesses: intense wind currents, bright open spaces, high-frequency sound.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Differences include depth-range frequency, membrane density, and cavern-adaptation patterns.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
They are valued for structural surveying and exploration roles, though their subdued behavior may seem unnerving to some species.
