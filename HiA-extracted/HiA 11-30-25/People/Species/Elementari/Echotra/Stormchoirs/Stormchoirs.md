# Stormchoirs (Echotra Subtype)

## 1. Species Summary
Stormchoirs are resonance-amplified Echotra adapted to high-energy stormbelts. Their bodies hold denser echo membranes capable of channeling high-decibel atmospheric forces.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Stormchoirs exhibit visible static flickers across the skin and sharper gaze fixation. Their posture reflects readiness for sudden energetic shifts.

## 3. Resonance Summary 
They produce thunder-like harmonic bursts and shockwave echoes. Full expression allows controlled resonance discharge, temporarily balancing local atmospheric instability.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Inhabit storm cliffs, volatile skyflow corridors, and regions prone to thunder-echo buildup.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Direct communication, abrupt tonal shifts, and decisive group coordination. They avoid overly quiet areas.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Strengths: shock resonance absorption, high-output harmonics, storm navigation.  
Weaknesses: tranquil zones, echo-dead caves, prolonged silence.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Ranges in thunder-pitch, resonance discharge frequency, and storm tolerance.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Respected for storm-guidance roles but may overwhelm quieter species.
