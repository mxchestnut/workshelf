# Echotra (Parent Species)

## 1. Species Summary
The Echotra are resonance-based humanoids whose biology is partially composed of vibrational energy rather than purely physical matter. Their bodies exhibit semi-translucent structures that refract sound and ambient atmospheric signals, allowing them to detect, interpret, and emit harmonic frequencies. They are considered a stable elemental-echo species native to Kael’s airborne environment.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Echotra exhibit subtle oscillations along the skin, clothing, or hair in response to sound or emotional stimulus. Their posture remains fluid, with movements synchronized to ambient wind currents. Eye luminescence fluctuates with resonance intensity, and faint harmonic undertones accompany speech.

## 3. Resonance / Awakening Summary (Condensed)
Their resonance development follows a gradual amplification pattern, beginning with increased sensitivity to environmental vibrations and culminating in controlled harmonic projection. Initial resonance manifestations include faint echo-trails and sensory harmonics. Full resonance expression allows precise modulation of frequency output for communication or defensive disruption.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Echotra gravitate toward regions with strong atmospheric flow or natural echo phenomena—cliffs, rivers, caverns, and open skyfields. Their physiology requires consistent vibrational input, making acoustically dead environments stressful. They play a stabilizing ecological role by dispersing sonic buildup and harmonizing turbulent skyflow pockets.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They form cooperative social groups aligned around harmonic compatibility, favoring consensus-based interaction. Echotra display strong attunement to group emotional states and adjust speech rhythm or tone to maintain cohesion. They prefer predictable environments and show low aggression, adapting poorly to chaotic or discordant social settings.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Echotra excel in sensory mapping, emotional resonance detection, and frequency-based communication across long distances. Weaknesses include vulnerability to overwhelming noise, dissonant magic, and environments with low atmospheric movement. Overuse of resonance results in oscillation instability and harmonic fatigue.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes
Echotra subtypes express adaptations to specific vibrational environments—windborne, aquatic, subterranean, and storm-aligned variants. Differences appear in resonance pitch range, echo emission strength, and environmental dependency. Subtype boundaries are stable and do not intermix.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Echotra interact well with species that use clear communication and stable emotional cues. They struggle with emotionally volatile or high-volume environments. Their resonance abilities make them valued in navigation, communication, and environmental surveying.
