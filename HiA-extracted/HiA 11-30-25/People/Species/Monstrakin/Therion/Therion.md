THERION LINE — Permanent Beastforms with Humanoid Intellect

## 1. Neutral Species Summary

Therions exhibit fully developed beast morphologies with retained humanoid cognitive function. Unlike Eidolons, they do not shift forms; their anatomy is permanently aligned to their ancestral beast-phenotype.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language

Therions communicate primarily through beast-coded cues—posture adjustments, ear positioning, vocalizations, tail movement, and scent markers. Their locomotive patterns follow their animal structure with no humanoid gait variance.

## 3. Awakening/Shift Summary

Therions have no shift cycle. Their developmental trajectory is stable from late adolescence onward. Physiological maturity grants increased coordination, enhanced senses, and refined motor control rather than morphic change.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology

Therions follow ecological patterns similar to natural predators or adapted fauna but with added tool-use and environmental planning due to humanoid cognition. They shape their habitats intentionally, creating dens, nests, or camps using crafted materials.

## 5. Social Tendencies

Therion groups behave as complex hybrid social units—part pack structure, part humanoid community. Leadership tends toward the physically or perceptually strongest, but intellectual strategists often hold advisory roles. They integrate into mixed populations with difficulty due to communication style differences.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses

Strengths include high sensory range, stable endurance, and predictable behavior patterns. Weaknesses include difficulty interacting in humanoid-designed spaces, increased vulnerability in environments that suppress natural senses, and risk of misinterpretation by non-Monstrakin.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes

Subtypes reflect a wide range of beast morphologies—canid, feline, ursine, reptilian, avian, and more. Variability affects body size, sensory specialization, diet, and group structure.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species

Therions are generally respectful but direct. Their communication style can be misread by humanoid species unfamiliar with beast cues. They build stable relationships with species that tolerate or understand animal-coded body language.
