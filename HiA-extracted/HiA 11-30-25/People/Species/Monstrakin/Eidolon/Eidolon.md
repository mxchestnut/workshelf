EIDOLON LINE — Humanoid-to-Beast Shifters

## 1. Species Summary

Eidolons retain a fully functional humanoid form but can transition into a beaststate reflective of their ancestral phenotype. Their shifting mechanism is physiological rather than magical, involving rapid tissue restructuring and metabolic reallocation.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language

In humanoid state, Eidolons display animal-coded microgestures—controlled stillness, predator-like eye focus, flared nostrils, or ear-muscle responsiveness (if applicable). Their body temperature and heart rate spike just prior to transformation.

## 3. Shift Summary (Condensed)

The shift is triggered by acute stress, intentional focus, or immediate environmental demand. Transition speed varies by individual and lineage but typically occurs within seconds. Recovery from shift requires caloric intake and rest due to metabolic strain.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology

Eidolons gravitate to regions matching their beastform’s ecological niche. Forest-adapted forms occupy dense woodlands; tundra variants inhabit cold highlands; aquatic morphs remain near rivers or lake systems. They show strong territorial attachment.

## 5. Social Tendencies

Eidolons engage in structured hierarchy groups when allowed to organize independently. Dominance and cooperation behaviors mirror their beast ancestry. In humanoid-dominant societies, they adapt but retain instinctive territorial behaviors.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses

Strengths include rapid burst power, sensory acuity, and form-specific advantages such as enhanced speed or camouflage. Weaknesses include high metabolic demand, reduced endurance during repeated shifts, and environmental mismatch if forced into incompatible regions.

## 7. Variability & Subtypes

Subtypes are determined by ancestral beast profiles (canine, feline, avian, reptilian, etc.). Variability expresses in coat pattern, skeletal morphology, shift speed, and sensory preference. Dormants do not exist; all Eidolons shift.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species

Generally cooperative but can appear intense or territorial. They respond well to direct communication and poorly to unclear social cues. Beastforms may intimidate non-Monstrakin unintentionally.
