# Godshards (Omnivora Line)
## 1. Species Summary
Godshards are an extremely rare Chakarova lineage characterized by unstable but immense spiritual potential. Their awakenings produce localized anomalous effects associated with fractal energy distortion and cosmic resonance. They represent the most unpredictable branch of Chakarova evolution.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Godshards show inconsistent physical indicators: momentary unfocused gaze, subtle spatial distortions around their silhouette, or pauses in movement during internal “echo” events. Their body language alternates between stillness and abrupt clarity, reflecting fragmented internal processes.

## 3. Awakening Summary (Condensed)
The “Shatter Cycle” defines their awakening process, beginning with anomalous coincidences and perceptual irregularities. The first full awakening is typically overwhelming and may involve temporary dissociation or sensory overload. Their resonance stabilizes only through deliberate grounding practices.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Godshards gravitate toward mythic, unstable, or magically active regions of Kael, often near leyline anomalies or ancient structures. They stabilize poorly in densely populated areas due to environmental resonance conflict. Their ecological presence correlates with minor atmospheric disturbances.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Social behavior is cautious and introspective, shaped by the need to manage unpredictable resonance events. Godshards generally avoid large-group dynamics and prefer limited social circles. They rely on trusted caretakers or mentors for grounding and avoid political or high-expectation environments.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
They possess high potential for resonance manipulation and perception beyond normal Chakarova limits. Weaknesses include fragmentation under stress, dissociation during celestial anomalies, and prolonged recovery after major awakenings. Fatigue may trigger minor spatial or perceptual distortions.

## 7. Variability & Dormants
Variability is extreme; no two Godshards express identical resonance signatures. Dormants are theoretically possible but undocumented. Mixed-lineage reproduction does not create new Godshards; individuals arise through rare, unexplained conditions.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Godshards are generally avoided or mythologized by non-Chakarova populations. Their presence may be interpreted as omens, causing social tension. They interact minimally but exhibit cooperative behavior when properly supported.
