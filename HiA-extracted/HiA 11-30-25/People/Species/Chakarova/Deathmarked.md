# Deathmarked (Sanguora Line)
## 1. Species Summary
The Deathmarked represent the Sanguora lineage, defined by heightened instinctive response, acute environmental awareness, and crisis-oriented awakening cycles. Their transformations are spirit-driven and often manifest through heat, pulse variation, and sharpened sensory focus rather than physical mutation.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Deathmarked individuals commonly display tension-ready posture, heightened alertness, and micro-reactions to sudden stimuli. Their breathing deepens under stress, and detectable warmth may radiate from the hands or chest during instinct spikes. Eye-tracking is rapid and environment-scanning behavior is frequent.

## 3. Awakening Summary (Condensed)
Their awakening follows the “Crisis Cycle,” often triggered by acute emotional or physical stress. Early awakenings manifest as abrupt instinct surges, heat waves, or reflexive movements. The first full awakening produces an intense internal pressure release accompanied by temporary hypersensitivity.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Deathmarked populations cluster in Kael’s frontier regions where instinct-based responses increase survival odds. They adapt well to harsh climates, high-risk environments, and volatile stormbelts. Their performance decreases in overly structured, low-stimulus environments where instinct lacks outlet.

## 5. Social Tendencies
They exhibit protective social patterns, forming tight-knit groups with strong loyalty bonds. Conflict resolution is direct, often shaped by emotional intensity. They excel in group roles requiring rapid reaction but show difficulty in environments that demand prolonged restraint or emotional suppression.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Deathmarked excel in environments that reward intuition and rapid response, making them formidable in crisis management. Their weaknesses include susceptibility to overreaction under ambiguous stimuli and difficulty regulating instinct during prolonged emotional stress. Energetic fatigue manifests as irritability or instinct “echoes.”

## 7. Variability & Dormants
Variability appears in the degree of instinct intensity and thermal fluctuations during awakening. Dormants exhibit strong gut intuition but lack overt resonance effects. Mixed-lineage offspring tend to express either Ascendant or Deathmarked traits depending on dominant emotional inheritance patterns.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Deathmarked interact effectively with species that value strength or direct communication. They struggle in environments that stigmatize emotional expression or instinct-driven action. Their protective tendencies make them reliable allies in multi-species frontier communities.
