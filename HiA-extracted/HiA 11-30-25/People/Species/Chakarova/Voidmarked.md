# Voidmarked (Apathra Line)
## 1. Species Summary
Voidmarked represent the Apathra lineage, defined by resonance collapse, emotional dampening, and subtle reality-distortion effects. Their awakenings manifest through localized sensory reduction and aura suppression rather than overt energy release.

## 2. Physical Tells & Body Language
Voidmarked individuals display muted facial expressions, reduced gestural range, and a tendency toward stillness. Environmental cues near them—sound, warmth, or light—may seem slightly diminished. Their gaze is often described as unfocused or “inward-facing.”

## 3. Awakening Summary (Condensed)
Their awakening follows the “Collapse Cycle,” beginning with emotional flattening and brief sensory voids. Full awakening produces a controlled zone of reduced stimulus perception. Triggers usually involve emotional overload or prolonged environmental stress.

## 4. Habitat & Ecology
Voidmarked cluster in neglected, low-energy environments such as fens, marshes, and abandoned settlements. They adapt poorly to overstimulating areas and prefer quiet, low-traffic regions. Their presence subtly reduces ambient wildlife activity.

## 5. Social Tendencies
Their social patterns are quiet, observant, and unobtrusive. They contribute stability to group dynamics but may be misinterpreted as detached. Voidmarked prefer small, emotionally calm groups and often avoid intense social confrontation.

## 6. Strengths & Weaknesses
Voidmarked excel in perception filtering, emotional detachment, and disruption of deceptive stimuli. Their weaknesses include vulnerability to emotional isolation, difficulty expressing internal states, and exhaustion during prolonged overstimulation. Fatigue manifests as increased void “bleed.”

## 7. Variability & Dormants
Variability appears in void intensity, stimulus dampening radius, and collapse sensitivity. Dormants exhibit mild emotional flatness but no void expression. Mixed-lineage inheritance does not produce blended traits; lineage dominance determines expression.

## 8. Behavior Around Other Species
Voidmarked coexist quietly with other species, rarely drawing attention. Some species misinterpret their presence as supernatural ill-omen, while others value their stability and observational precision. They integrate most effectively in low-conflict, solitary-leaning communities.
